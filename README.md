## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
I basicaly just wrote this to get my board to work and connect to VsCode. 
It took longer than I had hoped for this to work but im glad that I got it to work.
The software should be a lot more powerfull than an arduino. 
It's comparing an ARM procesor core to a random 2008 microcontroller.

```python
from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hello world!")
    sleep(1)

```

Here is what board I am using, don't have VsCode installed on this computer so I cant show it working.

### Wiring
There is zero wiring for this assignment as it is a test program to pring to the serial monitor.

### Reflection
It was super difficult to get everything setup. 




## How To Fix the LCD power issue with Metro M4 boards.

### Description & Code

* **The symptoms:**  LCD acting weird OR trouble with usb connection / serial monitor / uploading / etc.
* **The problem :** The LCDs occasionally draw too much power when we turn on the boards, and that makes parts of its serial communications crash.
* **The Solution:** Add this code, and wire a switch up, like the wiring diagram below:



```python
import board
import time
import digitalio
from lcd.lcd import LCD
from lcd.i2c_pcf8574_interface import I2CPCF8574Interface

# turn on lcd power switch pin
lcdPower = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D8)
lcdPower.direction = digitalio.Direction.INPUT
lcdPower.pull = digitalio.Pull.DOWN

# Keep the I2C protocol from running until the LCD has been turned on
# You need to flip the switch on the breadboard to do this.
while lcdPower.value is False:
    print("still sleeping")
    time.sleep(0.1)

# Time to start up the LCD!
time.sleep(1)
print(lcdPower.value)
print("running")

i2c = board.I2C()
lcd = LCD(I2CPCF8574Interface(i2c, 0x27), num_rows=2, num_cols=16)


# Loop forever.
while True:

```
