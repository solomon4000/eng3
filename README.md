## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
I basicaly just wrote this to get my board to work and connect to VsCode. 
It took longer than I had hoped for this to work but im glad that I got it to work.
The software should be a lot more powerfull than an arduino. 
It's comparing an ARM procesor core to a random 2008 microcontroller.

```python
from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hello world!")
    sleep(1)

```

//Note to self: please update this later



### Wiring
There is zero wiring for this assignment as it is a test program to pring to the serial monitor.

### Reflection
It was super difficult to get everything setup. The programing was super easy for me to do but getting the board to work properley took a solid 3 and a half hours. I am so glad that we got it working however as now I can save my work to here and there is zero chance of me loosing it. I was so done with using the web based IDE that would barely ran, was full of bugs, and didn't save my work half the time. 




## Servo motor/sweep

### Description & Code
For this assignment I was tasked with writing a program that would sweep a servo back and forth. After I got that working I needed to control a servo with either buttons or capacitive touch. Now because the buttons on this thing are so complicated I ended up having to use capacitive touch. Capacitive touch is when you touch a wire and it creates a tiny capacitor between you and ground which will result in a current sike that can be detected by the microcontroller/processor.  
```python
Code goes here
